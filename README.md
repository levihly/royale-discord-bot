## Introduction

Royale is a silly, funny way to compete with your friends! 

(Really just a little project to challenge myself!)

## Features

* A variety of game modes! (...only classic and Fortnite so far, but I'm working on others)
* Generates pictures using profile pictures for more engaging games!
* Large rosters of popular characters to add to your games!
